# Otringal (OTRINGAL.ILE, the game's island 4, cells x 384..576, z 448..640) from the user's sketch (2026-10-08: "Green is the track,
# pink are jump points and the red is intended to be a tunnel to drive through and the orange line represents a pit lane"). The sketch is
# the editor's minimap turned a quarter clockwise and stretched along the island (sketch x = 1141 - 1.47 * render y, sketch y = render x
# - 23, the render 4 pixels a cell from cell (384, 448)): E:\dump\TEMP\otr\sketchfit.py, centreline.py. One raised road, round the lap:
#
#  - the square island (the walled yard south-east of the town, scene 92): east along its south side, north along its east side, west
#    along its north side past the spaceship's pad, down the game's own slope into the building at its foot, through the bridge to the
#    town -- the game's tunnel, the bridge's tube cut open for the road -- and on under the gatehouse, climbing, up into the town;
#  - north-west through the lower town, north up through the upper town onto the straight along the palace's east side (the start line,
#    the pit lane on its left, between the race lanes and the palace);
#  - west along the island's north edge, south down its west side and a jump over the inlet, an S round the town's tanks, and down past
#    the west pier over the sea to the islets (a scene of their own: cube (6,9) has ground but no scene in the game -- RaceTrackIsland
#    .NewCubes);
#  - east along the south coast and a jump over the sea back onto the square island.
#
# Version 2 (the user, 2026-10-08: "re-do the Otringal track so it's closer to ground level ... we're driving down the in-game slope,
# through a short tunnel then up back onto our track"): the deck follows the ground (CLEAR over the ground under it, no steeper than
# GRADE), over the sea and gullies as a bridge, and through the bridge at the game's own tunnel's floor.
